# Captcha Solver Web Application

## Overview

This is a fully responsive web application designed to solve CAPTCHAs from provided image URLs. It allows users to submit a URL pointing to a CAPTCHA image, and the application will attempt to solve and return the CAPTCHA text. A default sample image is provided for immediate testing.

## Features

*   **Responsive Design:** Adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes (desktops, tablets, mobile devices).
*   **URL Input:** Accepts CAPTCHA image URLs via a query parameter (`?url=https://.../image.png`).
*   **Default Sample:** Includes a pre-configured sample CAPTCHA image for easy demonstration.
*   **Image Processing:** Capable of fetching and processing CAPTCHA images from external URLs.
*   **Solver Integration:** Integrates with a CAPTCHA solving mechanism (implementation details in Technical Details).

## Usage

1.  **Access the Application:** Open the deployed web application in your browser.
2.  **Solve a Specific CAPTCHA:** To solve a CAPTCHA from a specific URL, append the `?url=` parameter to the application's base URL followed by the direct URL to your CAPTCHA image.
